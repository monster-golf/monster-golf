<font class="sections">-What I Can Do For You-</font><br /><br />
Have you ever wished that you could just tell someone what you wanted your software application to do and they could actually do it?<br /><br />
Have you ever wished that you could find someone like that and then actually be able to afford making it a reality?<br /><br />
Have you ever wished that now that you could afford to do it that someone could actually get it done sometime this year?<br /><br />
Well, that someone exists and that someone is me.<br /><br />
Every business is unique in its own way. Every business has its own processes and those processes change over time.
That means that the software that you use should be adaptable as well. The problem is that most of the time you end up having to change your processes to fit the
way that your software works. It's kind of like the tail wagging the dog.<br /><br />
<font class="sections">-How We Interact-</font><br /><br />
I will speak with you on the phone or meet with you in person and discuss what it is that you are looking to accomplish. 
After that I will prepare a simple proposal that will outline what I heard you say which I will then break down into phases based on what seems to be of the highest priority.
It will also include what it will cost and how long it will take to complete.
I let you decide the pace at which you want to go.<br /><br />

if this sounds like something you are interested in.<br />I will get back with you within 24 hours.

<font class="sections">-Reports-</font><br /><br />
Data is key component of your business, you have piles of it, but nothing to review this data with. 
The application you do use doesn't have reports that actually tell you what you want. 
If you have struggled to use applications such as Crystal Reports to make your data work for you, 
I can build a web-based reporting system that displays information which will reveal the strengths and weakness of your company.
<br /><br />
<font class="sections">-Customer Relationship Management (CRM)-</font><br /><br />
There are a lot of people out there still trying to make ACT and Goldmine work for them.  
You may have even tried SalesForce.com.  
No matter what you've done it still doesn't do it the way you wished it did.  
I can create a web-based system that does exactly what you need it to do. 
It will be user friendly for everyone, and it will work the way you work with fields that match your terminology.
<br /><br />
<font class="sections">-Work Flow-</font><br /><br />
All companies have processes of some type.  
Those processes require multiple people to get involved.  
The problem is that you have no way to streamline the various touch points along the process because each department uses its own system.  
I can create a web-based system that will allow you to consolidate all of those systems into one centralized system.
